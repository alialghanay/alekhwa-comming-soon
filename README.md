# Our First Project: A Deal That Never Saw the Light

Our first opportunity came from a job interview at an advertising company that, oddly enough, wanted to hire developers. I was the first to be interviewed, but it didn’t take long for me to realize that the interviewer wasn’t actually looking to hire us—he just needed a website for his company.

Sensing an opportunity, I proposed that instead of hiring us, he could simply buy the product from us. He agreed, and we had our first client!

We quickly built a prototype and delivered it, thinking we were off to a great start. However, after several arguments with the client, the project fell apart before it even launched. Our first deal crashed and burned, but we weren’t ready to give up just yet.
